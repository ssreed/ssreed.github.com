    <p>After neglecting my site for a long time I decided to finally start tinkering with it again. My first version of the site was build using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, specifically <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a>. Since a Jekyll-Bootstrap project can be hosted and maintained on GitHub, I thought it would be the most straightforward approach to build my site. I&#39;ve had no issues for the year or so I used it. It was simple to modify, update and deploy. Additionally, there was an active Jekyll community on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll">stackoverflow</a> which I often referred to when I ran into problems. Now, all that being said, I think it&#39;s time to move on. One of the biggest reasons I decided to move on to <a href="http://docpad.org">DocPad</a> was because it gave the all the functionality I had with Jekyll but also provided a great <a href="http://docpad.org/docs/plugins">plugin</a> system which allows me to extend the functionality of my site. Another big reason I decided to try out DocPad was because it is built with Node.js instead of a Ruby-based project like Jekyll. What this means is I can use npm, which I already used, to install plugins or new features. For example if I want to install livereload, all I&#39;d have to do is run &#39;docpad install livereload&#39; which is basically the same thing as &#39;npm install docpad-plugin-livereload.&#39; How easy is that?! I&#39;m very pleased with the product so far. Keep a lookout as I&#39;ll continue to work on improving and updating my site in the coming months.</p>
